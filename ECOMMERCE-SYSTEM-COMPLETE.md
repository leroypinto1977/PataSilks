## 🔐 **User Segregation & Authentication System**

- ✅ **Admin users** → Automatically redirected to `/admin` dashboard
- ✅ **Regular users** → Redirected to homepage with shopping features
- ✅ **Middleware protection** → Prevents unauthorized access to admin routes

### **Authentication Flow**

```
1. User signs in → System checks user role in database
2. If role = 'ADMIN' → Redirect to Admin Dashboard
3. If role = 'USER' → Redirect to Customer Homepage
4. Unauthorized admin access → Redirect to homepage
```
